# Data-Governance
Data governance module 

Data governance is focused on people and their behaviors 

#### Chapter outliner:
* unpacking the definition of data governance
* Discovering the elements of a data governance program
* Understanding the role of data culture
* Determining data governance readiness

## Understanding Data Governance
 Data governance it's about proactively managing your data in order to support your organisation to achieve its strategy and objectives,it does this by improving the quality of your data

 Data Governance is simply a framework that you can use to proactively manage your data:
 * Framework needs three things:
   1. Policy= to mandate  how your organisation is going to manage data
   2. Roles and Responsibilities concerning data
   3. processes detailing what needs to be done to manage data
  
  ## What is meant by Governance
  Governance is a manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest.so it typically takes the form of how decisions are made ,regulated and enforced.

  * Governance is the system that formalizes control ,processes and accountabilities so that specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained .
  * This course is concerned with exploring techniques and approaches for deriving as much value from your data as possible while managing any associated risks
  * when data is managed well ,it can drive innovation and growth and can be an enterprise's most abundant and important level for success
  * well managed data can be transformational and it can support the desirable qualities of a data driven culture,this is when decisions at all levels of the organization are made using data in an informed and structured manner such that they deliver better outcomes internally and to customers
  * Successful data governance means that the data risks can be minimized and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease
  * The discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of the value of its information assets is called enterprise information management(EIM),Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM ,which includes using technologies and processes to elevate datA TO BE SHARED ENTERPRISE ASSET

## DATA GOVERNANCE VS DATA MANAGEMENT 

* ``Data governance`` is focused on roles and responsibilities ,policies ,definitions,metrics and lifecycle of data.
* ``Data management`` is the technical implementation of data governance for example databases ,data warehouses and lakes ,application programming interfaces(APIs) analytic
* dAtabases ,data warehouses and lakes ,application programming interfaces(APIs,analytics software ,encryption,data crunching and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions

## DATA GOVERNANCE VS INFORMATION GOVERNANCE
* ``Data governance`` generally focuses on data ,independent of its meaning,e.g you want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective,the interest here is in the data not as much in the business context.
* Information Governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organisation,customers and other stakeholders.

## The value of Data Governance
Data governance is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it,it forces a leap from an ad hoc approach to data to one that is strategic in nature\

Main advantages achieved by good data governance

* Reduced data management costs
* Improved data quality
* Reduced risks from data related issues
* Enhanced business performance
* Expanded data value
* increased data compliance
* improved data driven decision making
* Established rules for handling data
* Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
* improved data search
* Improved Data availability and accessbility

  Data governance does not emerge by chance,it's a choice and it requires organizational commitment and investment

## CREATING A DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM

The Basic Steps for creating a data governance program consist of the following 

1. Defining the vision ,goals and benefits
2. Analyzing the current state of data governance and management
3. Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan
4. Achieving leadership approval
5. Designing and developing the program
6. Implementing the program
7. Monitoring and measuring performance
8. Maintaining the program

Data governance is about managing data well and helping to deliver its optimum value to your organization ,it includes ensuring your data is available ,usable and seure,it's the action that team members take ,the policies and processes they must follow ,and the use of technologies thatr support them throughut the data lifecycle in their organisation.

## DEVELOPING A DATA GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

we need a basic set of guiding concepts and a structure in which to apply them ,this is called the data governance framework

### 1. ``LEADERSHIP AND STRATEGY.``

Your data governance program must always align with the strategy of the organization .Data plays a role in many aspects of organizational strategy ,including risk management ,innovation and operational efficiencies 
* when Mapping organizational strategy to data governance ,you need the support ,agreement and sponsorship of senior leadership,

### 2. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
Data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time,every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities.

### 3. ``POLICIES ,PROCESSES AND STANDARDS
AT the helm of every data governance program we have policies ,processes and standards that guide responsibilities and upport uniformity across the organization.Each of these must always be designed ,developed and deployed ,depending on the size and complexity of the organization,this can take significant effort.
**policies ,process and standards must include accountability and enforcement components;otherwise it's possible they wll be dead on arrival.**

### 4. Metrics 
Data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results .Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support,this includes funding . to know if efforts are delivering on the promise of the program,Based on the metrics.

### 5. TOOLS 
These include tools for master data management ,data catalogs,search,security ,integration,analytics and compliance

### 6. COMMUNICATIONS AND COLLABORATION
High quality communications are always key.it take many forms including in person meetings,emails ,newsletter and workshops.Chaneg management ,in particular requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their particular obligations
* Collaboration is essential and can be difference between success and failure.
* Good collaboration requires  a positive culture that rewards teamwork
* it also requires clear channels between teams such as regular meetings.

## PREPARING FOR DATA GOVERNANCE

We have prerequisites for data governance success.it include ensuring that the organization's strategy is fully aligned with the proposed program.

### WHAT IS DATA CULTURE ?
A study by IDC (international Data Corporation ) noted that organizations are spending billions of dollae on technological upgrades 
* Culture will always defeat the greatest of strategies almost every time.
* It refers to the overall attitudes,behaviors and practices within an organization that revolve around data .It's essentially  a work environment where data is valued as an asset,readily available to those who need it,and consistently used to inform decision - making

  Data culture refers to the overall attitudes, behaviors, and practices within an organization that revolve around data. It's essentially a work environment where data is valued as an asset, readily available to those who need it, and consistently used to inform decision-making.

Here are some key characteristics of a data culture:

* **Data-driven decision making:**  Instead of relying on intuition or guesswork, decisions are based on insights and evidence derived from data analysis.
* **Data accessibility:**  People across the organization have access to the data they need to do their jobs effectively.
* **Data literacy:**  Employees are equipped with the skills and knowledge to understand, interpret, and use data.
* **Data trust:**  There's a high level of trust in the data's accuracy and integrity.
* **Leadership commitment:**  Leaders actively promote the use of data and set an example for data-driven decision making.

Organizations with a strong data culture are better equipped to:

* **Make better decisions:** Data can help to identify trends, opportunities, and risks that might otherwise be missed.
* **Improve efficiency and effectiveness:** Data can be used to streamline processes, optimize resource allocation, and measure the impact of initiatives.
* **Gain a competitive advantage:** By using data to understand their customers and markets better, organizations can develop more targeted strategies and offerings.

### ASSESSING THE DATA CULTURE

Data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it.Effective data culture support and empower all employees 
* In data culture ,decisions don't rely on gut feelings ,guesses or opinion of the highest paid/ranking person in the room .Rather decisions are based on data and the insights they can produce
* To assess your organization's data culture, you can interview employees, observe decision-making processes, and look at how data is managed. This will help you determine the maturity of your data culture and whether it needs improvement.

## MATURING THE DATA CULTURE
Steps to improve an organization's data culture key points:
1. ``Leadership buy-in``: leaders need to actively communicate the importance of data and make data driven decisions themselves.Share success sories to illustrate the value of data
2. ``Data Skills Development``: provide basic training on data manipulation,analysis cleaning and visualization
3. ``Start small and celebrate progress``: Focus on achievable improvements rather than complex solutions.Celebrate successes to keep momentum going
4. ``Address resistance``: Expect challenges.Provide open communication channels and recognize employee efforts.

## ASSESSING DATA GOVERNANCE READINESS
Steps for designing and creating a data governance program

#### Checklist items that will help determine data governance readiness of organization
1. Basic of a data culture exists
2. Program is 100% aligned with business strategy
3. Snr leadership is 100% committed to the program and its goals
4. Snr leadership understands this is a strategic ,enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department
5. One or More sponsors have identified at an executive level
6. Program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term
7. Organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project
8. ```Documented ROI``,One has documented the return-on-investment(ROI)
9. ``Legal and compliance support``,Legal and compliance teams(internally or Externally) understand and support the goals of the program
10. ``Data Skills``Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey
11. ``IT Capability``,IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program

 ##### several factors can influence the success of the program.

* **Data Culture:** A foundation of data culture should be present.
* **Alignment with Strategy:** The program must align 100% with the business strategy.
* **Leadership Commitment:** Senior leadership needs to be fully committed to the program's goals and understand it's an enterprise effort, not just an IT project.
* **Executive Sponsorship:** Secure one or more executive sponsors.
* **Funding:**  Ensure funding is available for program creation and maintenance.
* **Long-Term View:**  Recognize data governance as an ongoing program, not a one-time project.
* **Documented ROI:**  Quantify the program's Return on Investment (ROI).
* **Legal and Compliance Support:** Legal and compliance teams need to understand and support the program's goals.
* **Data Skills:** Basic data skills are necessary within the organization.
* **IT Capability:** The IT organization must be equipped to support the program.
### DEFINING DATA 

Data refers to collections of digitally stored units ,The units represents something meaningful when processed for a human or a computer 
* Single units of data are refered to as ``datum`` and multiple units as ``data``
* Data is also defined based on its captured format 
- **``Structured``** : Data that has been **formatted to a set  structure**;each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database and it's ready for analysis.E.G **First name,Last name and phone number**
- **``Unstructured``** : Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used.More work is required to enable analysis.E.G **email content and social media posts**
- **``Semi-Structured``**: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed 

* Units of data are largely worthless until they are processed and applied .It's only then data begins a journey that ,when coupled with good governance and be very useful

#### ZETTABYTE ERA
Today, we live in the zettabyte era. A zettabyte is a big number. A really big number. It’s 1021, or a 1 with 21 zeros after it. It looks like this: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.

* Simplified technical explanation of what a zettabyte is,each byte is made up of eight bits.

### FROM DATA TO INSIGHT
Data that is never used is about as useful as producing reports that nobody reads .Assumption that you have data for a reason

## ROLE OF DATA IN THE 21st CENTURY
* Data has played significant roles in understanding the world,making informed decisions and problem-solving since the 19th century
* The quantity, quality, and availability of data have expanded rapidly, with the internet making information easily accessible.
* The depth, breadth, and quality of data are transforming how we learn, socialize, and entertain ourselves.
* Data's importance has elevated risks, with cyberattacks resulting in significant financial losses.

## Data-Driven Decision-Making
* Data aids decision -making by providing valuable insights ,as seen in customer reviews influencing restaurant choice
* Data -driven decisons vary in complexity;complexity ;choosing a restaurant based on reviews is simpler than entering a new market
* Market entry decisions require rich datasets for informed decisions choices ;without proper data analysis,costly mistakes can occur
* Abundant ,high quality data is crucial for effective decision-making in the 21st century
* Data governance is essential for ensuring data quality ,highlighting the importance of deliberate actions in maintaining data integrity.

## Data As The New Oil
* Clive Humby's analogy of  "data is the new oil" emphasizes the economic significance o data in the 21st century
* Just like oil ,data requires processing and analysis to unlock its value and usefulness
* Data powers digital economies with major firms like Facebook and google dominating through data driven-driven operations
* Industries across sectors are being transformed by digitalization and data utilization, shifting data management from cost centers to profit centers.
* Control over valuable data confers disproportionate power, raising concerns about centralized management by a few large entities.

## DATA OWNERSHIP
* Data ownership describes the rights a person, team, or organization has over one or more data sets. These rights may span from lightweight oversight and control to rigorous rules that are legally enforceable. 
* Data ownership entails the responsiblity and rights held by individuas,teams or organizations over specific data sets
* Ownership ranges fom light oversight to legally enforceable rules,especially concerning intellectual property like copyrights and trade secrets
* Accountability for every data set within an organization is crucial for effective management and decision making

## DATA ARCHITECTURE
* Data Architecture is a subset of enterprise architecture(EA) and focuses on designing and managing data to     
 align with the organization's business strategy.
* It serves as blueprint for how data supports organizational functions and technologies
* High -quality data architecture facilitates smoother organizational operations and enables successful digital transformations
* Key considerations of data architecture include ensuring data availability ,reducing complexity in data access,enforcing data protections ,adopting data standards ,and optimizing dara fow efficiency
* Data architecture reflects data governance practices ,indicating an organization's value for data as a critical business asset and its alignment with business needs.
* Data architecture is not solely a technical concern but a cross organization responsibilility ,facilitating efficient data flow across various business silos and serving multiple audiences in diverse forms

**At a minimum, data architecture considers and typically supports the following:**
1. Ensuring data is available to those who need it and are approved to use it
2. Reducing the complexity of accessing and utilizing data
3. Creating and enforcing data protections to support organnizational policies and obligations
4. Adopting and agreeing data standards
5. Optimizing the flow and efficient use of data to eliminate bottlenecks and duplication

Data architecture is direct reflection of data governance ,An established and functioning data architecture immediately signals that an organization values data

## THE LIFECYCLE OF DATA
