## Understanding Data Governance
 Data governance it's about proactively managing your data in order to support your organisation to achieve its strategy and objectives,it does this by improving the quality of your data

 Data Governance is simply a framework that you can use to proactively manage your data:
 * Framework needs three things:
   1. Policy= to mandate  how your organisation is going to manage data
   2. Roles and Responsibilities concerning data
   3. processes detailing what needs to be done to manage data
  
  ## What is meant by Governance
  Governance is a manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest.so it typically takes the form of how decisions are made ,regulated and enforced.

  * Governance is the system that formalizes control ,processes and accountabilities so that specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained .
  * This course is concerned with exploring techniques and approaches for deriving as much value from your data as possible while managing any associated risks
  * when data is managed well ,it can drive innovation and growth and can be an enterprise's most abundant and important level for success
  * well managed data can be transformational and it can support the desirable qualities of a data driven culture,this is when decisions at all levels of the organization are made using data in an informed and structured manner such that they deliver better outcomes internally and to customers
  * Successful data governance means that the data risks can be minimized and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease
  * The discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of the value of its information assets is called enterprise information management(EIM),Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM ,which includes using technologies and processes to elevate datA TO BE SHARED ENTERPRISE ASSET

## DATA GOVERNANCE VS DATA MANAGEMENT 

* ``Data governance`` is focused on roles and responsibilities ,policies ,definitions,metrics and lifecycle of data.
* ``Data management`` is the technical implementation of data governance for example databases ,data warehouses and lakes ,application programming interfaces(APIs) analytic
* dAtabases ,data warehouses and lakes ,application programming interfaces(APIs,analytics software ,encryption,data crunching and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions

## DATA GOVERNANCE VS INFORMATION GOVERNANCE
* ``Data governance`` generally focuses on data ,independent of its meaning,e.g you want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective,the interest here is in the data not as much in the business context.
* Information Governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organisation,customers and other stakeholders.

## The value of Data Governance
Data governance is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it,it forces a leap from an ad hoc approach to data to one that is strategic in nature\

Main advantages achieved by good data governance

* Reduced data management costs
* Improved data quality
* Reduced risks from data related issues
* Enhanced business performance
* Expanded data value
* increased data compliance
* improved data driven decision making
* Established rules for handling data
* Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
* improved data search
* Improved Data availability and accessbility

  Data governance does not emerge by chance,it's a choice and it requires organizational commitment and investment

## CREATING A DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM

The Basic Steps for creating a data governance program consist of the following 

1. Defining the vision ,goals and benefits
2. Analyzing the current state of data governance and management
3. Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan
4. Achieving leadership approval
5. Designing and developing the program
6. Implementing the program
7. Monitoring and measuring performance
8. Maintaining the program

Data governance is about managing data well and helping to deliver its optimum value to your organization ,it includes ensuring your data is available ,usable and seure,it's the action that team members take ,the policies and processes they must follow ,and the use of technologies thatr support them throughut the data lifecycle in their organisation.

## DEVELOPING A DATA GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

we need a basic set of guiding concepts and a structure in which to apply them ,this is called the data governance framework

### 1. ``LEADERSHIP AND STRATEGY.``

Your data governance program must always align with the strategy of the organization .Data plays a role in many aspects of organizational strategy ,including risk management ,innovation and operational efficiencies 
* when Mapping organizational strategy to data governance ,you need the support ,agreement and sponsorship of senior leadership,

### 2. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
Data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time,every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities.

### 3. ``POLICIES ,PROCESSES AND STANDARDS
AT the helm of every data governance program we have policies ,processes and standards that guide responsibilities and upport uniformity across the organization.Each of these must always be designed ,developed and deployed ,depending on the size and complexity of the organization,this can take significant effort.
**policies ,process and standards must include accountability and enforcement components;otherwise it's possible they wll be dead on arrival.**

### 4. Metrics 
Data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results .Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support,this includes funding . to know if efforts are delivering on the promise of the program,Based on the metrics.

### 5. TOOLS 
These include tools for master data management ,data catalogs,search,security ,integration,analytics and compliance

### 6. COMMUNICATIONS AND COLLABORATION
High quality communications are always key.it take many forms including in person meetings,emails ,newsletter and workshops.Chaneg management ,in particular requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their particular obligations
* Collaboration is essential and can be difference between success and failure.
* Good collaboration requires  a positive culture that rewards teamwork
* it also requires clear channels between teams such as regular meetings.

## PREPARING FOR DATA GOVERNANCE

We have prerequisites for data governance success.it include ensuring that the organization's strategy is fully aligned with the proposed program.

### WHAT IS DATA CULTURE ?
A study by IDC (international Data Corporation ) noted that organizations are spending billions of dollae on technological upgrades 
* Culture will always defeat the greatest of strategies almost every time.
* It refers to the overall attitudes,behaviors and practices within an organization that revolve around data .It's essentially  a work environment where data is valued as an asset,readily available to those who need it,and consistently used to inform decision - making

  Data culture refers to the overall attitudes, behaviors, and practices within an organization that revolve around data. It's essentially a work environment where data is valued as an asset, readily available to those who need it, and consistently used to inform decision-making.

Here are some key characteristics of a data culture:

* **Data-driven decision making:**  Instead of relying on intuition or guesswork, decisions are based on insights and evidence derived from data analysis.
* **Data accessibility:**  People across the organization have access to the data they need to do their jobs effectively.
* **Data literacy:**  Employees are equipped with the skills and knowledge to understand, interpret, and use data.
* **Data trust:**  There's a high level of trust in the data's accuracy and integrity.
* **Leadership commitment:**  Leaders actively promote the use of data and set an example for data-driven decision making.

Organizations with a strong data culture are better equipped to:

* **Make better decisions:** Data can help to identify trends, opportunities, and risks that might otherwise be missed.
* **Improve efficiency and effectiveness:** Data can be used to streamline processes, optimize resource allocation, and measure the impact of initiatives.
* **Gain a competitive advantage:** By using data to understand their customers and markets better, organizations can develop more targeted strategies and offerings.

### ASSESSING THE DATA CULTURE

Data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it.Effective data culture support and empower all employees 
* In data culture ,decisions don't rely on gut feelings ,guesses or opinion of the highest paid/ranking person in the room .Rather decisions are based on data and the insights they can produce
* To assess your organization's data culture, you can interview employees, observe decision-making processes, and look at how data is managed. This will help you determine the maturity of your data culture and whether it needs improvement.

## MATURING THE DATA CULTURE
Steps to improve an organization's data culture key points:
1. ``Leadership buy-in``: leaders need to actively communicate the importance of data and make data driven decisions themselves.Share success sories to illustrate the value of data
2. ``Data Skills Development``: provide basic training on data manipulation,analysis cleaning and visualization
3. ``Start small and celebrate progress``: Focus on achievable improvements rather than complex solutions.Celebrate successes to keep momentum going
4. ``Address resistance``: Expect challenges.Provide open communication channels and recognize employee efforts.

## ASSESSING DATA GOVERNANCE READINESS
