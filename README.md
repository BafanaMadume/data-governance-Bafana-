# Data-Governance
Data governance module 

Data governance is focused on people and their behaviors 

#### Chapter outliner:
* unpacking the definition of data governance
* Discovering the elements of a data governance program
* Understanding the role of data culture
* Determining data governance readiness

## Understanding Data Governance
 Data governance it's about proactively managing your data in order to support your organisation to achieve its strategy and objectives,it does this by improving the quality of your data

 Data Governance is simply a framework that you can use to proactively manage your data:
 * Framework needs three things:
   1. Policy= to mandate  how your organisation is going to manage data
   2. Roles and Responsibilities concerning data
   3. processes detailing what needs to be done to manage data
  
  ## What is meant by Governance
  Governance is a manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest.so it typically takes the form of how decisions are made ,regulated and enforced.

  * Governance is the system that formalizes control ,processes and accountabilities so that specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained .
  * This course is concerned with exploring techniques and approaches for deriving as much value from your data as possible while managing any associated risks
  * when data is managed well ,it can drive innovation and growth and can be an enterprise's most abundant and important level for success
  * well managed data can be transformational and it can support the desirable qualities of a data driven culture,this is when decisions at all levels of the organization are made using data in an informed and structured manner such that they deliver better outcomes internally and to customers
  * Successful data governance means that the data risks can be minimized and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease
  * The discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of the value of its information assets is called enterprise information management(EIM),Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM ,which includes using technologies and processes to elevate datA TO BE SHARED ENTERPRISE ASSET

## DATA GOVERNANCE VS DATA MANAGEMENT 

* ``Data governance`` is focused on roles and responsibilities ,policies ,definitions,metrics and lifecycle of data.
* ``Data management`` is the technical implementation of data governance for example databases ,data warehouses and lakes ,application programming interfaces(APIs) analytic
* dAtabases ,data warehouses and lakes ,application programming interfaces(APIs,analytics software ,encryption,data crunching and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions

## DATA GOVERNANCE VS INFORMATION GOVERNANCE
* ``Data governance`` generally focuses on data ,independent of its meaning,e.g you want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective,the interest here is in the data not as much in the business context.
* Information Governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organisation,customers and other stakeholders.

## The value of Data Governance
Data governance is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it,it forces a leap from an ad hoc approach to data to one that is strategic in nature\

Main advantages achieved by good data governance

* Reduced data management costs
* Improved data quality
* Reduced risks from data related issues
* Enhanced business performance
* Expanded data value
* increased data compliance
* improved data driven decision making
* Established rules for handling data
* Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
* improved data search
* Improved Data availability and accessbility

  Data governance does not emerge by chance,it's a choice and it requires organizational commitment and investment

## CREATING A DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM

The Basic Steps for creating a data governance program consist of the following 

1. Defining the vision ,goals and benefits
2. Analyzing the current state of data governance and management
3. Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan
4. Achieving leadership approval
5. Designing and developing the program
6. Implementing the program
7. Monitoring and measuring performance
8. Maintaining the program

Data governance is about managing data well and helping to deliver its optimum value to your organization ,it includes ensuring your data is available ,usable and seure,it's the action that team members take ,the policies and processes they must follow ,and the use of technologies thatr support them throughut the data lifecycle in their organisation.

## DEVELOPING A DATA GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

we need a basic set of guiding concepts and a structure in which to apply them ,this is called the data governance framework
![Screenshot 2024-04-30 134226](https://github.com/BafanaMadume/data-governance-Bafana-/assets/141032267/7bfac278-ebcc-4817-a132-e6a037ecc9cc)

### 1. ``LEADERSHIP AND STRATEGY.``

Your data governance program must always align with the strategy of the organization .Data plays a role in many aspects of organizational strategy ,including risk management ,innovation and operational efficiencies 
* when Mapping organizational strategy to data governance ,you need the support ,agreement and sponsorship of senior leadership,

### 2. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
Data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time,every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities.

### 3. ``POLICIES ,PROCESSES AND STANDARDS
AT the helm of every data governance program we have policies ,processes and standards that guide responsibilities and upport uniformity across the organization.Each of these must always be designed ,developed and deployed ,depending on the size and complexity of the organization,this can take significant effort.
**policies ,process and standards must include accountability and enforcement components;otherwise it's possible they wll be dead on arrival.**

### 4. Metrics 
Data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results .Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support,this includes funding . to know if efforts are delivering on the promise of the program,Based on the metrics.

### 5. TOOLS 
These include tools for master data management ,data catalogs,search,security ,integration,analytics and compliance

### 6. COMMUNICATIONS AND COLLABORATION
High quality communications are always key.it take many forms including in person meetings,emails ,newsletter and workshops.Chaneg management ,in particular requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their particular obligations
* Collaboration is essential and can be difference between success and failure.
* Good collaboration requires  a positive culture that rewards teamwork
* it also requires clear channels between teams such as regular meetings.

## PREPARING FOR DATA GOVERNANCE

We have prerequisites for data governance success.it include ensuring that the organization's strategy is fully aligned with the proposed program.

### WHAT IS DATA CULTURE ?
A study by IDC (international Data Corporation ) noted that organizations are spending billions of dollae on technological upgrades 
* Culture will always defeat the greatest of strategies almost every time.
* It refers to the overall attitudes,behaviors and practices within an organization that revolve around data .It's essentially  a work environment where data is valued as an asset,readily available to those who need it,and consistently used to inform decision - making

  Data culture refers to the overall attitudes, behaviors, and practices within an organization that revolve around data. It's essentially a work environment where data is valued as an asset, readily available to those who need it, and consistently used to inform decision-making.

Here are some key characteristics of a data culture:

* **Data-driven decision making:**  Instead of relying on intuition or guesswork, decisions are based on insights and evidence derived from data analysis.
* **Data accessibility:**  People across the organization have access to the data they need to do their jobs effectively.
* **Data literacy:**  Employees are equipped with the skills and knowledge to understand, interpret, and use data.
* **Data trust:**  There's a high level of trust in the data's accuracy and integrity.
* **Leadership commitment:**  Leaders actively promote the use of data and set an example for data-driven decision making.

Organizations with a strong data culture are better equipped to:

* **Make better decisions:** Data can help to identify trends, opportunities, and risks that might otherwise be missed.
* **Improve efficiency and effectiveness:** Data can be used to streamline processes, optimize resource allocation, and measure the impact of initiatives.
* **Gain a competitive advantage:** By using data to understand their customers and markets better, organizations can develop more targeted strategies and offerings.

### ASSESSING THE DATA CULTURE

Data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it.Effective data culture support and empower all employees 
* In data culture ,decisions don't rely on gut feelings ,guesses or opinion of the highest paid/ranking person in the room .Rather decisions are based on data and the insights they can produce
* To assess your organization's data culture, you can interview employees, observe decision-making processes, and look at how data is managed. This will help you determine the maturity of your data culture and whether it needs improvement.

## MATURING THE DATA CULTURE
Steps to improve an organization's data culture key points:
1. ``Leadership buy-in``: leaders need to actively communicate the importance of data and make data driven decisions themselves.Share success sories to illustrate the value of data
2. ``Data Skills Development``: provide basic training on data manipulation,analysis cleaning and visualization
3. ``Start small and celebrate progress``: Focus on achievable improvements rather than complex solutions.Celebrate successes to keep momentum going
4. ``Address resistance``: Expect challenges.Provide open communication channels and recognize employee efforts.

## ASSESSING DATA GOVERNANCE READINESS
Steps for designing and creating a data governance program

#### Checklist items that will help determine data governance readiness of organization
1. Basic of a data culture exists
2. Program is 100% aligned with business strategy
3. Snr leadership is 100% committed to the program and its goals
4. Snr leadership understands this is a strategic ,enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department
5. One or More sponsors have identified at an executive level
6. Program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term
7. Organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project
8. ```Documented ROI``,One has documented the return-on-investment(ROI)
9. ``Legal and compliance support``,Legal and compliance teams(internally or Externally) understand and support the goals of the program
10. ``Data Skills``Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey
11. ``IT Capability``,IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program

 ##### several factors can influence the success of the program.

* **Data Culture:** A foundation of data culture should be present.
* **Alignment with Strategy:** The program must align 100% with the business strategy.
* **Leadership Commitment:** Senior leadership needs to be fully committed to the program's goals and understand it's an enterprise effort, not just an IT project.

* **Legal and Compliance Support:** Legal and compliance teams need to understand and support the program's goals.
* **Data Skills:** Basic data skills are necessary within the organization.
* **IT Capability:** The IT organization must be equipped to support the program.
### DEFINING DATA 

Data refers to collections of digitally stored units ,The units represents something meaningful when processed for a human or a computer 
* Single units of data are refered to as ``datum`` and multiple units as ``data``
* Data is also defined based on its captured format 
- **``Structured``** : Data that has been **formatted to a set  structure**;each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database and it's ready for analysis.E.G **First name,Last name and phone number**
- **``Unstructured``** : Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used.More work is required to enable analysis.E.G **email content and social media posts**
- **``Semi-Structured``**: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed 

* Units of data are largely worthless until they are processed and applied .It's only then data begins a journey that ,when coupled with good governance and be very useful

#### ZETTABYTE ERA
Today, we live in the zettabyte era. A zettabyte is a big number. A really big number. It’s 1021, or a 1 with 21 zeros after it. It looks like this: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.

* Simplified technical explanation of what a zettabyte is,each byte is made up of eight bits.

## ROLE OF DATA IN THE 21st CENTURY
* Data has played significant roles in understanding the world,making informed decisions and problem-solving since the 19th century
* The quantity, quality, and availability of data have expanded rapidly, with the internet making information easily accessible.
* The depth, breadth, and quality of data are transforming how we learn, socialize, and entertain ourselves.
* Data's importance has elevated risks, with cyberattacks resulting in significant financial losses.

## Data-Driven Decision-Making
* Data aids decision -making by providing valuable insights ,as seen in customer reviews influencing restaurant choice
* Data -driven decisons vary in complexity;complexity ;choosing a restaurant based on reviews is simpler than entering a new market
* Market entry decisions require rich datasets for informed decisions choices ;without proper data analysis,costly mistakes can occur
* Abundant ,high quality data is crucial for effective decision-making in the 21st century
* Data governance is essential for ensuring data quality ,highlighting the importance of deliberate actions in maintaining data integrity.

## Data As The New Oil
* Clive Humby's analogy of  "data is the new oil" emphasizes the economic significance o data in the 21st century
* Just like oil ,data requires processing and analysis to unlock its value and usefulness
* Data powers digital economies with major firms like Facebook and google dominating through data driven-driven operations
* Industries across sectors are being transformed by digitalization and data utilization, shifting data management from cost centers to profit centers.
* Control over valuable data confers disproportionate power, raising concerns about centralized management by a few large entities.

## DATA OWNERSHIP
* Data ownership describes the rights a person, team, or organization has over one or more data sets. These rights may span from lightweight oversight and control to rigorous rules that are legally enforceable. 
* Data ownership entails the responsiblity and rights held by individuas,teams or organizations over specific data sets
* Ownership ranges fom light oversight to legally enforceable rules,especially concerning intellectual property like copyrights and trade secrets
* Accountability for every data set within an organization is crucial for effective management and decision making

## DATA ARCHITECTURE
* Data Architecture is a subset of enterprise architecture(EA) and focuses on designing and managing data to     
 align with the organization's business strategy.
* It serves as blueprint for how data supports organizational functions and technologies
* High -quality data architecture facilitates smoother organizational operations and enables successful digital transformations
* Key considerations of data architecture include ensuring data availability ,reducing complexity in data access,enforcing data protections ,adopting data standards ,and optimizing dara fow efficiency
* Data architecture reflects data governance practices ,indicating an organization's value for data as a critical business asset and its alignment with business needs.
* Data architecture is not solely a technical concern but a cross organization responsibilility ,facilitating efficient data flow across various business silos and serving multiple audiences in diverse forms

**At a minimum, data architecture considers and typically supports the following:**
1. Ensuring data is available to those who need it and are approved to use it
2. Reducing the complexity of accessing and utilizing data
3. Creating and enforcing data protections to support organnizational policies and obligations
4. Adopting and agreeing data standards
5. Optimizing the flow and efficient use of data to eliminate bottlenecks and duplication

Data architecture is direct reflection of data governance ,An established and functioning data architecture immediately signals that an organization values data

## THE LIFECYCLE OF DATA
![Screenshot 2024-05-02 115625](https://github.com/BafanaMadume/data-governanceBafana-/assets/141032267/9629ec53-59e5-4d1e-977d-5eb04fae6f62)

1. **``Creation``** =  stage at which data comes into being ,it may be manual or automated and get created internally or externally .Data is created all the time by a vast number of activities that include system inputs and outputs

2. **``Storage``** = once data is created and assuming you want it available for later use,it must be stored .it most likely will be contained and managed in a database.The database needs a home ,too,as a local hard ,server ,or cloud service

3. **``Usage``** =  Data is captured and stored with the intention of utilizing it, possibly for analysis. It may require processing, such as error cleansing, format transformation, and access rights security.

4. **``Archival``** =  Unused data is identified and moved to long-term storage outside the production environment for potential future retrieval and utilization.

5. **``Destruction``** = At a logical point or as required by regulations or policies, data is made inaccessible and unreadable, sometimes involving physical destruction of devices like hard drives.

## UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF BIG DATA
* Data has been captured and stored in analog forms for millennia, such as the Romans using ledgers.
* Technological advancements driven by events like the Cold War and the space race led to innovations in computing and telecommunications
* The U.S. Census played a significant role in the origin of data processing, leading to the automation of tabulating census results by companies like the Tabulating Machine Company, later known as IBM.
* Punch cards were used as a form of data storage, allowing for automated counting and processing of census data.
* IBM and other data processing companies began to automate various aspects of life, leading to increased productivity across multiple sectors.
* These developments led to the information age, marking the third industrial revolution, characterized by the widespread use of data as a raw material for productivity and innovation.
* Connectivity facilitated the free flow of information across devices, organizations, and geographies, leading to an explosion in data creation, storage, and usage.
* The sheer volume and velocity of data created a challenge known as "big data," where traditional software applications struggled to manage the vast amounts of data generated.

## DEFINING BIG DATA

 Big  data is structured and unstructured data is so massive and complex in scale,that it's difficult and often impossible and often impossible to process via traditional data management techniques

 ### Defining Big Data

 * **``Volume``**= sheer scale of data being produced is unprecendented and requires new tools ,skills and processes
 * **``Variety``** = lots of legacy file formats ,such as CSV and MP3 and with new innovations ,new formats are emerging all the time .This requires different methods of handling ,from analysis to security
 * **``Velocity``** = Data creation and movement occur at high speeds due to numerous collection points, digital interfaces, and widespread connectivity. For instance, Instagram users share 65,000 pictures per minute in 2021.
 * **``Variablity``** = Data creation and flow are unpredictable ,leading to variability in data patterns and sources
 * **``Veracity``** = The quality of large volumes of disperate data sets varies ,posing challenges to data management ,including accuracy and truthfulness

### Consequences of Big Data

* ``DATA QUALITY``: Up to 80% of data is unstructured, presenting challenges for organizations in terms of analysis and accessibility. Duplicative and erroneous data further complicate matters
* ``Value and Innovation``: Despite challenges, big data provides significant value to organizations and drives remarkable innovation, such as self-driving cars and optimized supply chains.
* ``Advertising Effectiveness``: Big data revolutionizes advertising by enabling marketers to understand the marketplace in granular detail, target specific audiences or individuals, and optimize advertising efforts for higher sales conversion rates.

## Enter the Realm of Smart Data

* ``Smart Data Definition``: Smart data refers to optimized big data that has been prepared for specific uses to deliver maximum business value, overcoming challenges of volume, velocity, and variety.
  
* ``Utilization``: Smart data enables precision targeting in marketing, real-time analytics in manufacturing, and other tailored applications by applying processes to extract relevant insights.
  
* ``AI Integration``: Artificial intelligence is increasingly used to analyze unstructured big data, identifying patterns and extracting relevant information with reduced time and errors, facilitating the creation of previously inaccessible data subsets.
  
*Point of Collection: Smart data solutions are often applied at the point of data collection, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness compared to post-processing approaches.

*Value of Data: In the 21st century, all forms of data, whether big, small, or smart, can have value, emphasizing the importance of data governance across various data types.

* Delivering insight from data
* Recognizing that data is an asset
* Exploring four approaches to data analytics

## Identifying the roles of Data

### OPERATIONS
Business operations concern themselves with a diverse set of activities to run the day-to-day needs and drive the mission of an organization. Each business has different needs, and operational functions reflect these specific requirements. 
* Operations use data to make decisions, enable systems to run, and deliver data to internal and external entities

* **Core Operational** Functions: Business operations encompass various activities tailored to the specific needs of an organization, such as payroll, order management, and marketing.
* **Data Creation and Utilization:** Operations generate and utilize vast amounts of data for decision-making, system functionality, and communication with internal and external stakeholders.
* **Quantification of Performance:** Data enables the quantification of operational performance, allowing for insights into metrics like job openings, hiring duration, and applicant acceptance rates.

* **Automated Data Functions:** Many operational data functions are automated, such as warehouse inventory systems generating replenishment orders based on stock levels or automated notifications for time and expense reports.
* **Skilled People, Processes, and Technologies:** Operational data management involves skilled personnel, dedicated processes, and various technologies focused on handling and leveraging operational data effectively.

* Operations use data to make decisions, enable systems to run, and deliver data to internal and external entities.

### STRATEGY
Every organization has a strategy, whether it’s articulated overtly or not. At the organizational level, this is about creating a plan that supports objectives and goals.
* **``Strategy leads``** to implementation and requires the support of operations to realize its goals. In this way, strategy and operations are two sides of the same coin.
* Creating a strategy typically comes down to a core set of activities. It begins with an analysis of the environment followed by some conclusions on what has been gathered.

* **``Strategy Development``**: Every organization, department, or division has a strategy aimed at achieving objectives and goals. It involves understanding challenges, proposing solutions, and creating plans.
  
* **``Relationship between Strategy and Operations``**: Strategy and operations are interconnected, with operational excellence essential for realizing strategic goals. A data-driven strategy combined with operational efficiency can lead to success.
  
* **``Core Activities of Strategy Creation``**: Strategy development involves analyzing the environment, drawing conclusions, and creating plans guided by principles derived from various factors.
Role of Data: Good quality data is crucial for strategy development, providing the foundation for processing, analysis, and actionable insights.

* **``Incorporating Multiple Perspectives``**: While data is essential, other perspectives, including experiential knowledge, must also be considered in strategy development to ensure a balanced approach.
  
* **``Ongoing Strategy Development``**: Strategy development is an ongoing process, with periodic revisions based on new data and insights to adapt to changing environmental conditions.
  
* **``Importance of Data in Reaction System:``** In the 21st century, organizations need to react quickly to environmental changes, with data forming the backbone of their response systems.

*  A best practice for strategy development is to consider it an ongoing process.,In the 21st century, organizations need to react quickly to environmental conditions to survive. Data will form the backbone of your response system.

### DECISION-MAKING

* generally accepted in business that the highest form of value derived from data is the ability to make better-informed decisions.
* Data is crucial for making informed decisions in business and healthcare
* Abundance of data and accessible analysis tools have transformed decision-making processes
* Access to real-time data allows executives to understand dynamics promptly
* Relying on poor-quality or outdated data can lead to severe consequences ,from minor errors to business failure
* Quality data, obtained at the right time ,is essential for successful data-driven decision making
* Within organizations ,access to adundant data and information has resulted in quicker ,timeous ,and better-quality business decisions

### MEASURING
* Organizations are constantly engaged in measurement,whether overct or tacit ,to build a picture of their business.
* The adage "what gets measured gets managed"holds true ,but not everything can be easily measured.
* leaders aspire to have timely access to necessary information ,which is derived from data resulting from measurement
* Data measurements can be quantitative (numerical) or qualitative(descriptive_
* Quantitative data is expressed in nnumerical terms
* qualitative data is descriptive and language based
* The desired type of information dictates the measurement approach,influencing choices regarding what,when,where and how data is captured
* It's essential to cpture and measure only what matters ,considering resource limitations and potential costs

### MONITORING 
Monitoring is an ongoing process of collecting and evaluating the performance of ,say,a project,process,system ,or another item of interest
* Monitoring: Continuously checking performance against goals.
 * Applies to projects, systems, processes, etc.
 * Compares results to targets (e.g., machine output vs. expected output).
 * Ensures stability, continuity, and reliability.
 * Uses data from the monitored item and the monitoring process itself.
 * Data feeds reports, dashboards, and real-time systems.
 * Provides insights to guide decisions (e.g., identify low productivity or equipment failure).
 * Data is key: measurement is needed for monitoring. 
 * Different teams may handle data collection, monitoring, and taking action.
 * Data monitoring: ensures data quality and fitness for use.
 * Involves setting and measuring data quality metrics (completeness, accuracy).
 * Helps identify data issues and opportunities for improvement. 
* Monitoring is another process that converts data into insight and as such ,exist as a mechanism to guide decisions
* By continuously monitoring the quality of the data in your organization,opportunities and isses

### INSIGHT MANAGEMENT


**Insight management is the process of collecting, analyzing, and communicating data in a way that helps people make better decisions.** It involves understanding what data is important, how to analyze it, and how to present the findings in a way that is easy to understand.

In essence, insight management is about turning data into actionable insights that can be used to improve decision-making throughout the organization.

| Insight Management Activities | Description |
|---|---|
| Data gathering and analysis | This involves collecting data from a variety of sources, such as internal databases, customer surveys, and social media. Once the data has been collected, it needs to be cleaned and analyzed to identify trends and patterns. |
| Communication of findings | Once the insights have been identified, they need to be communicated to the right people in a way that is easy to understand and act on. This may involve creating reports, presentations, or dashboards. |

Here are some of the benefits of effective insight management:

* Improved decision-making: By having access to better data and insights, organizations can make more informed decisions that are likely to lead to better outcomes.
* Increased efficiency: Insight management can help organizations to identify areas where they can streamline their operations and improve efficiency.
